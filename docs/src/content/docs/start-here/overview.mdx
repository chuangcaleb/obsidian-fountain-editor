## 🎯 Goals

| 📍  | Make Obsidian an impressive option for writing screenplays                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 🔗  | The main selling point is to be able to **connect/link/annotate your helper notes directly with your screenplay**, at the exact location where you referenced it, by allowing Markdown links/tags/extended syntax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 🤞  | The 2nd selling point is to **integrate the Fountain screenwriting workflow with all of Obsidian's ecosystem** that fosters _idea-exploration_ and _knowledge-management_ _(Plus, psssst, it's **FREE**)_.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 🧩  | In a similar vein, certain **Obsidian plugins can add sorely missing features in your Fountain screenplay writing workflow**. The chief missing jigsaw piece that bothers me is that [Fountain requires all your content in a single file](https://github.com/chuangcaleb/ffluent#purpose) — which can get tedious when you have 120+ pages. There's an [Obsidian plugin solution for this](https://github.com/kevboh/longform), and [likely one for any problem](#-synergistic-tools). |
| 🔎  | Competition does not mean lack of cooperation! As explained in our [design principle of scope](/docs/basic/design-guidelines.md#🔬-scoped), **this plugin will try to not do double-work** if possible, and will try to outsource/handover features to other [Synergistic Tools](#-synergistic-tools)!                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Get Fountain syntax highlighting** in Editing View (Source mode or Live Preview)!
- ✅ **Specify which individual notes get Fountain styling** with `cssclasses: fountain` in your frontmatter _(opt-in basis, subject to change)_
- 🛁 **Enjoy extended Obsidian syntax** where possible — bring your regular Obsidian markdown, tools, plugins, and workflow!
  - 🧰 **Leverage Obsidian!Markdown**: Use Links, Tags, Embedded Notes / Images / Audio, Graph...
  - 🛏️ **Feel at home**: Fountain's [Section](https://fountain.io/syntax/#sections-synopses) and [Emphasis](https://fountain.io/syntax/#emphasis) syntax don't add new styles — which means they'll look like familiar Obsidian [Headings](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Headings) and [inline text styles](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Styling+text)!
  - 🪓 **Opt-out** into regular Obsidian!Markdown syntax highlighting with [Fountain's Synopsis](https://fountain.io/syntax/#sections-synopses) token or [Obsidian's comment blocks](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#Comments)!
- 🤝 **Combine with your favorite Obsidian community plugins** like [Longform](https://github.com/kevboh/longform)!
- 🔧 **Fine-tune** the styling using CSS variables with the format `--fountain--*`... see [base.css](src/styles/base.css) for the exposed CSS variables!
- 🧑‍💻 **Hack in missing features** — with Obsidian's open-contribution development, there'll be no more "it would've been perfect, if only they had _x_ feature"!
