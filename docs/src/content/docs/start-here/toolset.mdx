## What is Markdown?

> Markdown is a **simple markup language** that you can use to add formatting to plaintext text documents ([Getting Started | Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/))

Markdown is what I'm using to write what you're seeing. For example, to **bold words**, you wrap text in double-asterisks `**like this**`. There's a "Source" Mode where you see all the ugly prefix/inline-symbols, then there's a "Preview" rendered mode where all the formatting/styling gets applied according to the symbols that you used.

There's no one official markdown "application". It can be used anywhere. That's the beauty.

- **FREE**: Pay nothing.
- **Robust**: Used for websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
- **Portable**: Open and edit with any program. Export and import seamlessly.
- **Platform-independent**: Any device with any OS.
- **Future-proof**: Open, non-proprietary file formats; no vendor lock-in. Preserved for forever.

## What is Obsidian?

> Obsidian is the private and flexible **writing app** that adapts to the way you think. ([Obsidian - Sharpen your thinking](https://obsidian.md/))

I've used Obsidian for academic note-taking, reflective daily journaling, task/project planning, blog writing, exploring/synthesizing ideas, and now story-planning/writing. It's a great app, in general.

Each note/file uses the markdown format (see above), which provides tools for you to churn out **beautiful, semantically-structured text**. Links, Tags and community tools help you **easily connect complex files/ideas into a web of information** in digital formatâ€”like a "second brain".

- **FREE**: Pay nothing.
- **Markdown**: All the perks aforementioned above.
- **Local Files**: Just regular files, stored in a folder, on your device.
  - **Privacy**: No data gets sent to anyone's cloud servers, so never worry about leaks.
  - **Speed**: Local access is magnitudes faster than cloud access. SPEED is why I searched for a Notion alternative.
  - **Accessibility**: Offline-first access.
- **Customizable**: 2000+ community plugins & themes for every workflow & style â€” or develop your own, like I'm doing!

## What is Fountain?

![a graphic showing how the Fountain specification works](https://fountain.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fountain-reference.jpg)

Fountain is an amazing markup syntax that **strips away all the complexities** of formatting/styling, so that you can **focus on what matters most: <u>content</u>**. The syntax covers everything you really need. I never want to write in any other way.

Fountain was inspired by Markdown's design philosophy and principles, though they were never conceived to be used side-by-side. There are many excellent applications for writing screenplays in either pure Fountain, or pure Markdown. But not bothâ€”until now.

- **FREE**: Pay nothing.
- **Markdown**: All the perks aforementioned above.
  - **Plain-text**: Functional, even without the styling!
  - **Portable**: Archive it forever. Share it easily. Use plenty of compatible apps.
  - **Version-controllable**: Something I've never really seen done before, where you can use tools like Git to track the history of edits, or even create alternate-timeline git-branches of changes!
