<Aside type="tip">
	üìç Make Obsidian _lack nothing_, as if it writing Fountain screenplays was an
	originally intended use case.
</Aside>

## üîÄ Interoperable / Portable

**Work within a screenplay document _just_ like you would with a regular Obsidian note.**

To leverage the power of interlacing Obsidian!Markdown and Fountain within a single document, we need to be able to write Markdown and Fountain syntax _interchangeably_ and _without friction_.

It so happens that Obsidian-flavored Markdown plays quite well with Fountain syntax, generally. We still need to define some rules for those overlapping areas. You can read more at [Conflicts between Obsidian-flavored Markdown vs Fountain](/docs/resources/syntax-conflicts).

### ‚úÖ Fountain-compliant by default

If a markdown file is written in Fountain syntax, then the entire document (syntax) contents should be immediately **_100% compatible for Fountain_** processors and exporters.

If it is not possible, then any non-Fountain-syntax should be trivially resolvable by simple regex/text pattern matching rules.

This is so that:

1. This Obsidian plugin will have less trouble/complexity because it doesn't have to figure out which regions are Fountain, and which are not.
2. You'll be able to directly integrate with other Fountain-related tools with the same file (reference)!

A written comparison between writing in `.md` files vs in `.fountain` files is [coming soon](https://github.com/chuangcaleb/obsidian-fountain-editor/issues/1).

### ‚öñÔ∏è Styling Parity

The **_syntax styling in the Obsidian editor should be as similar to a Fountain-exported PDF_** as possible.

### ü•á Fountain-first

A **_Fountain-first user_**, who has no previous knowledge of Obsidian or Markdown, should be able to write a full Fountain document with as little friction as possible.

### ü•à Obsidian-second

An **_Obsidian-first user_** may be allowed to lose/forfeit their usual/familiar Obsidian syntax **IF** it conflicts with standard Fountain syntax.

### ü™ì Provide Escape Hatches

Since Fountain takes precedence, we should have Fountain-compliant methods to write sections of regular Markdown!

## üö∏ Parallel

**Fountain-styled notes should live in parallel with regular Obsidian/Markdown notes.**

While "**Interoperable**" deals with the hybrid nature of a single file/note, **Parallel** addresses the hybrid nature of a vault/folder of files/notes.

According to [Interoperable](#-interoperable--portable)#1 (Fountain-compliance), files will be either regular Obsidian markdown, or completely Fountain-compliant.

We should be able to mark/declare certain files to be Fountain-formatted, or to define some glob pattern for a group of files. Right now, you can enable Fountain formatting by marking a file with the frontmatter metadata Property `cssclasses: fountain`.

Then, Obsidian note-making is business as usual, until we come across a file that is marked for Fountain-formatting. That is the scope that this plugin will operate in.

(Implementation is subject to change! See [this discussion](https://github.com/chuangcaleb/obsidian-fountain-editor/discussions/4) for a possible alternative.)

## üî¨ Scoped

**This plugin should do [one thing well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), instead of many things half-baked.**

"Lacking nothing" is different from "having everything"...

Should overly-extensive requirements arise, a brand new/additional tool should be created/used. The numerous [Longform - Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/kevboh/longform) features should already cover almost all your additional needs, like [configurable manuscript compilation](https://github.com/kevboh/longform/blob/main/docs/COMPILE.md) and [word count](https://github.com/kevboh/longform/blob/main/docs/WORD_COUNTS.md)!

See [Synergistic Tools](/docs/resources/synergistic-tools) for more recommendations!

### üé® View-only

This plugin should be scoped to only making visual changes to the Obsidian editor. This means that this plugin will try to avoid any feature that makes changes to files.
