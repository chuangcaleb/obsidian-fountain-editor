### Apps for writing/exporting Fountain

- [Highland 2](https://www.highland2.app/)

  - Made by the creator of Fountain.
  - Features its own text editor app, WYSIWYG, "Revision Mode" and analysis tools.
  - Since everything is wrapped in a nice bow, it's probably the best Fountain-writing app if you're not technical.

- Final Draft
- betterfountain
- afterwriter
- beat

### Apps for compiling notes

- [chuangcaleb/ffluent](https://github.com/chuangcaleb/ffluent): CLI to bundle atomic Fountain screenplay files
  - My attempt to replicate `longform` but for Fountain files, as a CLI.
  - Uses a json/yaml file at each folder directory to configure a custom sequence! So you can have complex folder organization structures
  - Marked as abandoned since this project, but it may be of interest to you!
