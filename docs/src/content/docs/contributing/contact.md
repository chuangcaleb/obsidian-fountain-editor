This is a side project that I enjoy working on in my free time, after my day job and life responsibilities. You can expect delayed responses, but I will try my best to address them all and learn about the community!

The [General - Discussions](https://github.com/chuangcaleb/obsidian-fountain-editor/discussions/categories/general) tab is a neat place you can just tag me in, because you also invite anyone from the community to join in the conversation! It's also better for keeping the context scoped within this project/repo.

If you want a more personal DM'ing (or just to send a private note of thanks!), you can reach me on Discord[#chuangcaleb](https://discordapp.com/users/199882835685801984)! You can also reach out by email to [dev@chuangcaleb.com](mailto:dev@chuangcaleb.com)!
