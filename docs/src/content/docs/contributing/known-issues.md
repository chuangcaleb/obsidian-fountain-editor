- Boneyard token `*/` is formatted as emphasis/italics by Obsidian. In Live Preview, the `*` the syntax token is hidden.
  - I don't use Boneyards as much, especially now with the `%% Obsidian comment %%` syntax. Low priority.
- The project may not work on every Obsidian theme. It is validated on the Default theme (as well as Minimal, which is the most downloaded theme). Please [open a bug report](https://github.com/chuangcaleb/obsidian-fountain-editor/issues/new?template=bug.yml) if it is broken on your theme.

## Roadmap

- Formatting in Reading Mode
- Scene numbering
- `_` Fountain underline token syntax styling
