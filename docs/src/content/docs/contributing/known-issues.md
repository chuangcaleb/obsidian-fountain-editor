- Boneyard token `*/` is formatted as emphasis/italics by Obsidian. In Live Preview, the `*` the syntax token is hidden.
  - I don't use Boneyards as much, especially now with the `%% Obsidian comment %%` syntax. Low priority.
- Validated on Default theme. May not work on every theme

## Roadmap

- Formatting in Reading Mode
- Scene numbering
- `_` Fountain underline token syntax styling
